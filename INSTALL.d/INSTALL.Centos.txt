=================================
= Installing imapsync on CentOS = 
=================================

There is one section for Centos 7 and one for Centos 6.

==============
== Centos 7 ==
==============

First install access to the Epel repository via yum:

  yum install epel-release

Then install imapsync and its dependencies:

  yum install imapsync

After installing imapsync, it should be able to work on your system.
A good test that shows also the basic example:

  imapsync


==============
== Centos 6 ==
==============

This section has not been tested with latest imapsync releases (2014 and after)
so it can fail. In case it happens, just write me at gilles.lamiral@laposte.net 
and we will fix it together. 

First, install access to the Epel repository
 
  wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
  rpm -Uvh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Then install all other packages via yum:
 
  yum install \
perl-Mail-IMAPClient    \   
"perl(Term::ReadKey)"   \ 
"perl(Authen::NTLM)"    \
perl-Data-Uniqid          \
perl-File-Copy-Recursive  \
perl-IO-Tee               \
perl-Unicode-String
