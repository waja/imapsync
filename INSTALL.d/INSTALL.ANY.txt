               Installing imapsync on other Unixes
=======================================================================


Purchase imapsync at
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/
or get it anywhere.

You have access to a compressed tarball called imapsync-1.xxx.tgz
where 1.xxx is the version number. Untar the tarball where
you want:

  cd 
  tar xzvf  imapsync-1.xxx.tgz

Go into the directory imapsync-1.xxx

  cd imapsync-1.xxx

You can easily detect any missing Perl modules via the 
script prerequisites_imapsync located in the INSTALL.d directory:

  sh INSTALL.d/prerequisites_imapsync

or 

  cd INSTALL.d/
  sh prerequisites_imapsync

You don't need to be root to run the previous command. You have
to be root if you want the Perl modules to be available for the 
whole system, for all users.

You may be in one of following cases: 
- you are not root.
- you are in a environment where modifying system Perl 
  modules can break other things or where you're not allowed to
  change the whole system.

The "make" command is a prerequisite to build some Perl modules.
Install make in case it is not already installed.

Run the "cpanm" command with the missing Perl modules as arguments.
For example it can be:

  cpanm Authen::NTLM Data::Uniqid File::Copy::Recursive IO::Tee \
        Mail::IMAPClient Unicode::String Encode::IMAPUTF7

Once you've run the "cpanm" command, you can rerun "sh prerequisites_imapsync" 
to verify everything is ok:

  sh prerequisites_imapsync 

When everything is ok the script execution ends with this sentence
"All needed modules are already installed"

Now imapsync should work on your system. To check it run:

  ./imapsync --testslive
