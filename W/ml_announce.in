Dear imapsync user,

You're subscribed to the newsletter announcing imapsync new releases
(very few traffic) and the way to get them. Send me a note if you
don't want to receive those announces anymore.

You will find the latest imapsync.exe binary (release M4_imapsync_VERSION)
and the latest imapsync source code (release M4_imapsync_VERSION) at the following link:

  http://imapsync.lamiral.info/dist/M4_SECRET_PATH/

or also more permanently from this page 

  http://imapsync.lamiral.info/paypal_return.shtml 

Three important files are there:
* imapsync            is directly the perl script (also found in the tarball and zip) for a fast upgrade.
* imapsync-M4_imapsync_VERSION.tgz  is the tarball containing everything of the project (maybe too much)
* imapsync.M4_imapsync_VERSION.zip  is the win32 zip archive including standalone binary imapsync.exe.

What's new in this M4_imapsync_VERSION release can be found at
http://imapsync.lamiral.info/S/news.shtml

I wish you successful imap transfers!

Feedback is welcome!
