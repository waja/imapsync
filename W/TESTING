TESTING on Unix
---------------

Tests will break as they are home specific.
You need a running imap server on localhost with several accounts
toto with a password located in the file $HOME/var/pass/secret.toto
titi with a password located in the file $HOME/var/pass/secret.titi
tata with a password located in the file $HOME/var/pass/secret.tata

Of course, you can change the file tests.sh and run tests with:

  sh -x tests.sh

Specific tests can be run by using them as argument to tests.sh:

  sh -x tests.sh ll_ssl_justconnect ll_bad_host ...

The tests.sh script break on first failure ("set -e" directive).

Since I added more tests you also need a remote imap server see the
file tests.sh and help yourself. No time to make a universal test
file.
