# INSTALL file for imapsync 
# imapsync : IMAP sync or copy tool.

INTRODUCTION
------------

 imapsync works fine under any Unix OS with perl.
 imapsync works fine under Windows (2000, XP) and ActiveState's 5.8 Perl

 imapsync is already available directly on the following distributions (at least):
 FreeBSD, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, NetBSD, Darwin, Mandriva and OpenBSD (yeah!).

 Get imapsync at
 http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync/dist/

 You'll find a compressed tarball called imapsync-x.xx.tgz
 where x.xx is the version number. Untar the tarball where
 you want (on Unix):

 tar xzvf  imapsync-x.xx.tgz

 Go into the directory imapsync-x.xx and read the INSTALL file.
 You're already reading the INSTALL file.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need : 
- Perl 
  try : perl -v

  Get Perl here:
  http://www.perl.org/

- Some perl modules. To verify you have
  all modules in one command, just run:

  perl -c imapsync

  The good answer is "imapsync syntax OK".

Here is some individual module help:

- Perl Mail::IMAPClient module 
  try : 

  perl -mMail::IMAPClient -e ''
  
  Get the Mail::IMAPClient module here:
  http://search.cpan.org/
  http://search.cpan.org/~djkernen/
  http://search.cpan.org/~djkernen/Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9/
  
  In fact I use Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9
  To know the version you have on your system try :

  perl -mMail::IMAPClient -e 'print $Mail::IMAPClient::VERSION, "\n"'

  New Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx works now with imapsync,
  at least with Mail-IMAPClient-3.19 (previous may bug)

- Perl Digest::MD5 module. 
  http://search.cpan.org/
  http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/Digest-MD5-2.36/
  To know the version you have on your system try :
  perl -mDigest::MD5 -e 'print $Digest::MD5::VERSION, "\n"'
  I use 2.36 (debian etch package)

- Term::ReadKey
  perl -mTerm::ReadKey -e ''

- IO:Socket:SSL.pm
  perl -mIO::Socket::SSL -e ''

- Date::Manip
  perl -mDate::Manip -e ''

- (Option) Perl Digest::HMAC_MD5 module
  Good for non plain text password over network.


INSTALLING
----------
To see what will be done, just run:

make -n install

To install imapsync, just run:

make install

or copy the file imapsync where you want it to be.

WINDOWS
-------

- Install Perl if it isn't already installed.
  ActivePerl from ActiveState is a good candidate if
  you understand nothing at free/open software
  and want to run imapsync with success.
- Use PPM to install modules listed in the PREREQUISITES section.
  PPM is Perl Package Manager.

TESTING
-------

The test will break as they are home specific.
You need a running imap server on localhost with several accounts
toto with a password located in the file $HOME/var/pass/secret.toto
titi with a password located in the file $HOME/var/pass/secret.titi
tata with a password located in the file $HOME/var/pass/secret.tata

Of course, you can change the file tests.sh and run the tests with :

sh -x tests.sh

The tests.sh script break on first failure ("set -e" directive).

Since I added more tests you also need a remote imap server see the
file tests.sh and help yourself. No time to make a universal test
file.
