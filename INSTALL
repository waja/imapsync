Purchase imapsync at
http://imapsync.lamiral.info/
or get it anywhere.

You have access to a compressed tarball called imapsync-1.xxx.tgz
where 1.xxx is the version number. Untar the tarball where
you want:

  cd 
  tar xzvf  imapsync-1.xxx.tgz

Go into the directory imapsync-1.xxx

  cd imapsync-1.xxx

You can easily detect any missing Perl modules via the 
script prerequisites_imapsync located in the INSTALL.d directory:

  sh INSTALL.d/prerequisites_imapsync

or 

  cd INSTALL.d/
  sh prerequisites_imapsync

You don't need to be root to run the previous command. You have
to be root if you want the Perl modules to be available for the 
whole system, for all users.

You may be in one of following cases: 
- you are not root.
- you are in a environment where modifying system Perl 
  modules can break other things or where you're not allowed to
  change the whole system.

In the previous cases, you have to reinit cpan in order to use 
your local account:

FIX. The following commands can be replaced by what is described in
"Installing imapsync script on Darwin / Mac OS X"
at http://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/INSTALL.Darwin.txt


  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  # then inside the cpan shell type "o conf init"
  cpan> o conf init
  cpan> exit
  # finally source your modified local bashrc
  . $HOME/.bashrc

Run again prerequisites_imapsync

  sh INSTALL.d/prerequisites_imapsync

Run the "cpan -i" command with the missing Perl modules as arguments.
For example it can be:

  cpan -i Authen::NTLM Data::Uniqid File::Copy::Recursive IO::Tee Mail::IMAPClient Unicode::String

Once you've run the "cpan -i" command, you can rerun "sh prerequisites_imapsync" 
to verify everything is ok:

  sh prerequisites_imapsync 

When everything is ok the script execution ends with this sentence
"All needed modules are already installed"

Now imapsync should work on your system.
