http://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ

Unix versus Windows syntax.
There are several differences between Unix and Windows
in the command line syntax. 
- Character \ versus ^
- Character ' versus "


A) \ versus ^

On Unix shells you can write a single command on multiple lines
by using the escape character \ at the end of each line 
(except the last one). On Windows this character is ^

Unix example:

./imapsync \
   --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 \
   --host2 imap.trac.org --user2 bar --password2 secret2


Windows example:

imapsync ^
   --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 ^
   --host2 imap.trac.org --user2 bar --password2 secret2


Of course you can write the command on one only line without 
characters \ nor ^. I use them because the output is
better, no truncation, pretty print. It's just sugar.

In this FAQ I use \ for examples. Transcript to ^ if
you're on a Windows system.

B) ' versus " 

On Windows the single quote character ' doesn't work
like on Unix so in the examples of this FAQ the 
command containing single quotes ' will fail on Windows.
To fix it just replace single quotes ' by double quotes "

Also on Windows, in examples with \$1 replace 
any \$1 by $1 (remove the \ before $).

=======================================================================
Q. How to verify imapsync.exe I got is the right file bit per bit?

R. Use md5sum to check integrity of the file.
   Get md5sum.exe at http://etree.org/md5com.html

   md5sum imapsync.exe

   Then compare the checksum with the one given by the author.

=======================================================================

=======================================================================
Q. Can I copy or sync Calendar or Contacts with imapsync?

R. No. It's because most IMAP servers don't get contacts and calendar 
events via IMAP. In other words, messages synced by imapsync from 
Calendar or Contacts folders are not used by email servers to set 
or get the contacts or calendars. 
No way via IMAP, no way via imapsync.
See next question.

=======================================================================
Q. How can I copy or synchronize Calendars or Contacts?

R1. It can't be done with imapsync.

R2. It can be done, depending on the email server softwares used.

a) From Exchange to Exchange, export contacts and calendar to
   PST format files on host1 and import them on host2.

b) From Gmail to Gmail, export and import calendars in ical format, 
   extension for those files is .ics.
   Contacts can be copied using a csv file. See the help page
   http://support.google.com/mail/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=1669027

c) Etc. Search the web. There's also specific tools and paid services.
   There's no silver bullet to migrate Calendars and Contacts,
   if you find one, tell me!


=======================================================================
Q. Where I can find old imapsync releases?

R. Search the Internet.

=======================================================================
Q. Where I can find free open and gratis imapsync releases?

R. Search the Internet.

Q. Is is legal to find imapsync gratis (or not) elsewhere?

R. Yes, the license permits it
   http://imapsync.lamiral.info/NOLIMIT

=======================================================================
Q. How "Facts and figures" are known on http://imapsync.lamiral.info/

R. To know wether a newer imapsync exists or not imapsync does a http 
   GET to http://imapsync.lamiral.info/VERSION
   Via the User-agent parameter it also send:

    * imapsync release
    * Perl version
    * Mail::IMAPClient version
    * Operating System

You can remove this behavior by adding option --noreleasecheck on the
command line (or by setting $releasecheck = 0 in the source code) 

=======================================================================
Q. I use --useuid which uses a cache in /tmp or --tmpdir, the hostnames
   host1 or host2 has changed but mailboxes are the same. Will imapsync
   generate duplicate messages on next runs?

R. Yes

Q. How can I fix this?

R. The cache path reflects hostnames or ip addresses, just change the
   directory names of host1 or host2. Use --dry to see if next runs
   will generate duplicates.
   By default the cache is like 

   /tmp/imapsync_cache/host1/user1/host2/user2/...

=======================================================================
Q. How can I speed up transfers?

R. By using --useuid imapsync avoid getting messages headers and build
   a cache. On Unix a good thing is to add also --tmpdir /var/tmp
   to keep the cache since /tmp is often cleared on reboot.

   imapsync ... --useuid 

On Unix:

   imapsync ... --useuid --tmpdir /var/tmp/

R. Add also --nofoldersizes since the default behavior is to compute
   folder sizes. Folder sizes are useless for the transfer, just 
   useful to see what has to be done on each folder and guess when 
   the transfer will end (ETA).

R. Add also --noexpungeaftereach if you use --delete. 
   But be warn that an interrupted transfer can loose messages 
   on host2 in a second run if you use a (silly) combination like

   imapsync ... --delete --noexpunge --noexpungeaftereach --expunge2

R. Add also --nocheckmessageexists
   --nocheckmessageexists is on by default since release 1.520.
   Since transfer can be long on a huge mailbox imapsync checks
   a message exist before copying it, but it takes time and 
   cpu on the host1 server. 


Notes about --useuid

Case where building the cache first is necessary (to avoid multiples transfers)

If you run again imapsync with --useuid on a transfer  already done without 
--useuid then, to avoid messages be copied again, first run imapsync 
with --usecache but without --useuid, example scenario:

A] Running with the default options, I began without --useuid 

1) First run with default options

  imapsync ...

Too slow, I want to speed up!

2) Build the cache

 imapsync ... --usecache

3) Speed up now

  imapsync ... --useuid

B] I began with --useuid from the first time

1) First run and next runs with --useuid

  imapsync ... --useuid


Inodes number issue.

The cache is simple, it uses the file-system natively, 
it's just an empty file per message transfered.
When mailboxes are huge the cache can exhaust the number of inodes 
allowed in the filesystem, that's a limitation like limitation
size but it's less often encountered.

On Unix, to predict whether your tmpdir filesystem used by imapsync 
will support the whole cache, just run the command "df -i /var/tmp", 
if /var/tmp is the --tmpdir argument.

On windows, search and drop me a note about how to count the number 
of files allowed in the filesystem. 
It seems FAT32 supports 268 435 445 clusters.

Choosing the number of inodes allowed by a filesystem can be done 
at the creation of it with "mkfs -N number-of-inodes ..."

imapsync can predict how many messages have to be synced with the 
option --justfoldersizes (no transfer will be done)

  imapsync ... --justfoldersizes


=======================================================================
Q. I see warning messages like 
"Host1 Sent/15 size 1428 ignored (no header so we ignore this message)"
What can I do to transfer those messages?

R1. Use --addheader option, it will add a header like
   "Message-Id: <15@imapsync>" and transfer the message on host2.
   Duplicates won't happen in next runs.

   imapsync ... --addheader

R2. Use --useuid then imapsync will avoid dealing with headers.

   imapsync ... --useuid

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, with --useuid or --usecache a problem occurs with long
   nested folder names. The error message is:
   "No such file or directory; The filename or extension is too long"

R. This comes from a Windows limitation on pathnames.
No more than 260 characters are allowed for pathnames.
See more details on page
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247.aspx#maxpath
The workaround solution given at the previous link, 
ie using \\?\D:", does not work for imapsync. 
So this imapsync Windows bug is still pending and needs a fix using 
a different technic to cache, like a database file for example.

A solution to fix the issue is to use a Linux virtual host on a 
Windows box, with VirtualBox or VmWare etc. There is no bug this way,
pathnames can be several thousands charaters long.
Better said that done but not so difficult nor expensive these days,
VirtualBox is free and VmWare Player is free for personal or test use.

If you have to stick on Windows, there are two good workarounds 
to reduce the cache directory name:

1) Use --tmpdir "D:\\temp" or simply --tmpdir "D:" and imapsync
will build and use the cache in the sub directory 
D:\imapsync_cache\

2) add two equivalent entries in the etc/hosts for host1 imap.truc.org 
and host2 imap.trac.org. 
If you map the ip of imap.truc.org just with the letter a 
and same thing for imap.trac.org then you gain characters

etc/hosts

192.168.12.1 a
192.168.55.3 b

Then use:

  imapsync --host1 a --host2 b ...

You can get the ip of a host with the ping command line
C:\> ping imap.truc.org

Fixing the long path problem directly in imapsync is in the TODO file.

=======================================================================
Q. How can I try imapsync with latest Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx perl module?

Three solutions at least.

R1 - Look at the script named "i3" in the tarball, it can be used to
     run imapsync with the included Mail-IMAPClient-3.35/ wherever you 
     unpacked the imapsync tarball

R2 Run:

   perl -MCPAN -e "install Mail::IMAPClient"

   or

   cpan -i Mail::IMAPClient

R3 If you want to install the Perl module locally in a directory

   - Download latest Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx at
     http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/

   - untar it anywhere:
        tar xzvf Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx.tar.gz

   - Get any imapsync (latest is better).

   - run imapsync with perl and -I option tailing to use the perl
     module Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx. Example:

         perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.35/lib  ./imapsync ...

     or if imapsync is in directory /path/
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.35/lib   /path/imapsync ...


=======================================================================
Q. How can I use imapsync with Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 perl module?

R. Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 is no longer supported.

=======================================================================
Q. I get "Out of memory" errors. How to fix that?

R. Usually "Out of memory" errors are related to old days,
to old Mail::IMAPClient module releases, before 3.26.
Look at imapsync output first lines to get the Mail::IMAPClient release used.
Then upgrade Mail::IMAPClient Perl module if needed.

=======================================================================
Q. Can I use imapsync to migrate emails from pop3 server to imap server?

R1. No. 
You can migrate emails from pop server to imap server with pop2imap:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/pop2imap/

R2. Yes 
Many pop3 servers runs in parallel with an imap server on exactly 
the same mailboxes. They serve the same INBOX
(imap serves INBOX and several other folders, pop3 serves only INBOX)
So have a try with imapsync on the same host1.

=======================================================================
Q. Folders are not created on host2. What happens?

R. Do you use IMAP or POP3 with your client software?
It looks like you use POP3 instead of IMAP, POP3 sees only INBOX.


=======================================================================
Q. I am interested in creating  a local clone of the IMAP on a LAN 
server for  faster synchronizations, email will always be delivered 
to the remote server and so the synchronization will be one way - from 
remote to local. How suited is imapsync for continuous one-way 
synchronization of mailboxes? Is there a better solution?

R. If messages are delivered remotely and you play locally with the
copy, in order to have fast access, then the synchronization can't
be one way. You may change flags, you may move messages in 
different folders etc.

A better tool with this scenario is offlineimap, 
designed for this issue, and faster than imapsync.

=======================================================================
Q. We have found that the time and date displayed have been changed to 
   the time at which the file was synchronized. 

R. This is the case by default with some email readers like:
   - Outlook 2003
   - Ipad

but not with:

   - Mutt
   - Thunderbird
   - Zimbra
   - Gmail


A thing to keep in mind, imapsync does not touch any byte of messages 
unless told to do so by option --regexmess. 
Messages on both parts should be identical.

I explain the whole picture about dates of messages.

There are several different dates for any message.
First, there is the "Date:" header. Most of the time, this date is set 
by the MUA. MUA means Mail User Agent; it is Outlook, Mutt
or Thunderbird. The Date header is usually the date the message was written 
or sent the first time. It is never changed by any transfer or copy.
If an email reader uses the Date header for displaying the date of a 
message then no problem should arise.

There is also the internal date. In IMAP the internal date is handled
and normally it corresponds to the arrival date in the mailbox. The 
IMAP protocol allows the internal date to be set by a email client.
Imapsync synchronizes internal dates by default, internal dates on host2
should then be the same as the internal dates on host1. 
If an email reader uses the internal date for displaying the date of a 
message then the sync date problem only occurs when the host2 server software
ignores the internal date given by imapsync during the APPEND imap 
command. It happens with some imap servers.

There are also the Received header lines. Each time a message travels
a SMTP server, this one adds a Received header line. Sometimes 
some email clients use the last "Received" header date as the date of the
message. And some IMAP servers softwares add a Received line after
and imap transfer. If those both conditions are met then the date
displayed become the transfer date even if imapsync 
has done its best to keep all the dates synchronized. Bad luck.



Solutions: 
a) Use a better email client or configure it in order it sorts messages
by sent date, the Date header.

b) Use a imap server that respects the imap RFC and accepts 
the internal date set by imapsync. 

c) Try to understand why the reader shows another date. 
For Exchange look at the next FAQ item.



=======================================================================
Q. imapsync calculates 479 messages in a folder but only transfers 400 
   messages. What's happen?

R1. Unless --useuid is used, imapsync considers a header part 
   of a message to identify a message on both sides.
   By default the header part used is lines "Message-Id:" "Message-ID:" 
   and "Received:" or specific lines depending on --useheader 
   --skipheader. Whole header can be set by --useheader ALL

Consequences:

  1) Duplicate messages (identical header) are not transferred
     several times.

The result is that you can have more messages on host1 than on host2.

R2. With option --useuid imapsync doesn't use headers to identify
messages on both sides but it uses their imap uid. In that case
duplicates on host1 are transfered on host2.

=======================================================================
Q. How can I remove duplicates on a unique host

R. Just run imapsync on the same account with option --delete2,
   ie with host1 == host2 and user1 == user2

=======================================================================
Q. I need to log every output on a file named log.txt

R. Use redirections of both standard and error outputs "> log.txt 2>&1"

  imapsync ... > log.txt 2>&1

This syntax is available both on Windows and Unix.

=======================================================================
Q. I need to log every output on a file named log.txt and also to the 
   screen in order to keep seeing what's going on during execution

R. Use the tee program (also available on Windows)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_%28command%29
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/796476/displaying-windows-command-prompt-output-and-redirecting-it-to-a-file
http://code.google.com/p/wintee/


  imapsync ...  2>&1 | tee log.txt

=======================================================================
Q. Can I run more instances of imapsync in parallel on a Windows host.

R. Yes!

Q. Any performance issue?

You have to try and check the transfer rates, sum them up to
have a uniq numeric criteria. 
There is always a limit, depending on remote imap servers 
and the one running imapsync;
CPU, memory, Inputs/Outputs are the classical bottlenecks, 
the worst bottleneck is the winner that sets the limit.

examples/sync_loop_windows.bat says
...
REM ==== Parallel executions ====
REM If you want to do parallel runs of imapsync then this current script is a good start.
REM Just copy it several times and replace, on each copy, the csvfile variable value.
REM Instead of SET csvfile=file.txt write for example
REM SET csvfile=file01.txt in the first copy
REM then also 
REM SET csvfile=file02.txt in the second copy etc.
REM Of course you also have to split the data contained in file.txt
REM into file01.txt file02.txt etc.
REM After that, just double-click on each batch file to launch each process


=======================================================================
Q.  I run multiple imapsync applications at the same time then get a
    warning "imapsync.pid already exists, overwriting it".
    Is this a potential problem when trying to sync multiple 
    IMAP account in parallel?

R1. No issue with the file imapsync.pid if you don't use its content
by yourself. 

This file can help you to manage multiple runs by sending signals 
to the processes (sigterm or sigkill) using their PID.
Each run can have its own pid file with --pidfile option.
The file imapsync.pid contains the PID of the imapsync process.
This file is removed at the end of a normal run.
You can safely ignore the warning if you don't use imapsync.pid file.


=======================================================================
Q. Couldn't create [INBOX.Ops/foo/bar]: NO Invalid mailbox name: 
INBOX.Ops/foo/bar 

Let begin by an explanation.

Example:
sep1 = /
sep2 = .

imapsync reverts each separator automatically. 

a) All / character coming from host1 are converted to . (convert the separator)
b) All . character coming from host1 are converted to / (to avoid 
intermediate unwanted folder creation). 

So 
INBOX/Ops.foo.bar (Ops.foo.bar is just one folder name) will be translated to 
INBOX.Ops/foo/bar 

Sometimes the sep1 character is not valid on host2 (character "/" usually)

R. Try :

  --regextrans2 "s,/,X,g"

It'll convert / character to X 
Choose X as you wish: _ or SEP or 
any string (including the empty string).

This issue is automatically fixed by default since imapsync 
release 1.513, use --nofixslash2 to suppress the fix.

=======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to sync also the UIDL of the POP3 server?

R. imapsync does not POP3 but I think you mean UID in IMAP.
   See next question.

=======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to sync also the UIDs of the IMAP server?

UIDs in IMAP are chosen and created by the servers, not by the clients,
imapsync is a client. So UIDs can not be synced by any method,
unless the server is duplicated as is.

=======================================================================
Q. The option --subscribe does not seem to work

R1. Use it with --subscribed

R2. There is also the --subscribe_all option that subscribe
to all folders on host2.

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify a date range to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share an example?

R. Yes, with the --search option.

  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010"

   Jan

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify an age to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share some examples?

R. Yes, with the --maxage or the --minage option.

E.1 Sync only messages less than 2 days old:

  imapsync ... --maxage 2

E.2 Sync only messages more than 2 days old:

  imapsync ... --minage 2

E.3 Sync only messages more than 30 days old and less than 365 days old:

  imapsync ... --minage 30 --maxage 365

E.4 Sync only messages less than 30 days old or more than 365 days old:

  imapsync ... --maxage 30 --minage 365

Full explanation:

--maxage      <int>    : Skip messages older than <int> days.
                         final stats (skipped) don't count older messages
                         see also --minage
--minage      <int>    : Skip messages newer than <int> days.
                         final stats (skipped) don't count newer messages
                         You can do (+ are the messages selected):
                         past|----maxage+++++++++++++++>now
                         past|+++++++++++++++minage---->now
                         past|----maxage+++++minage---->now (intersection)
                         past|++++minage-----maxage++++>now (union)

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync retain the \Answered and $Forwarded flags?

R. It depends on the destination server.

a) If the destination server honors the "PERMAENTFLAGS \*" 
directive (meaning it accepts any flag) or no PERMAENTFLAGS at all 
then imapsync synchronizes all flags except the \Recent flag
(RFC 3501 says about \Recent flag "This flag can not be 
altered by the client.").

b) If the destination server honors the "PERMAENTFLAGS without the 
special "\*"  then imapsync synchronizes only the flags listed 
in PERMANENTFLAGS.

Some imap servers have problems with flags not beginning with
the backslash character \ 
(see next question to find a solution to this issue)


=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way to only sync messages with a specific flag set, 
for example, the \Seen flag? 

R. use --search 

  imapsync ... --search SEEN

or

  imapsync ... --search UNSEEN

or ...

The complete list of search things are listed below

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html

6.4.4.  SEARCH Command
...
      ALL
         All messages in the mailbox; the default initial key for
         ANDing.

      ANSWERED
         Messages with the \Answered flag set.

      BCC <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's BCC field.

      BEFORE <date>
         Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone)
         is earlier than the specified date.

         Messages that contain the specified string in the body of the
         message.

      CC <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's CC field.

      DELETED

         structure's FROM field.

      HEADER <field-name> <string>
         Messages that have a header with the specified field-name (as
         defined in [RFC-2822]) and that contains the specified string
         in the text of the header (what comes after the colon).  If the
         string to search is zero-length, this matches all messages that
         have a header line with the specified field-name regardless of
         the contents.

      KEYWORD <flag>
         Messages with the specified keyword flag set.

=======================================================================
Q. How to convert flags?

R. use --regexflag
For example to convert flag IMPORTANT to flag CANWAIT

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/IMPORTANT/CANWAIT/g" --debugflags

option --debugflags is usefull to see in details what imapsync
does with flags.

=======================================================================
Q. How to fix this error: BAD Invalid system flag \FORWARDED 

R. Filter flag \FORWARDED with --regexflag like this:

On Windows:

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/\\FORWARDED//g" 

On Unix:

  imapsync ... --regexflag 's/\\FORWARDED//g' 

or

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/\\\\FORWARDED//g" 


=======================================================================
Q. How to convert flags with $ to \ character?

R. $ and \ are special characters we have to "escape" them.
For example to convert flag $label1 to \label1

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/\$label1/\\label1/g" --debugflags

=======================================================================
Q. I need to keep only a defined list of flags, how can I do?
The destination imap server complains about bad flags (Exchange).

R1. Recent imapsync deals with this issue by filter with PERMANENTFLAGS
automatically.

R2. For example if you want to keep only the following flags
\Seen \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft
then use these magic --regexflag options (thanks to Phil):

 --regexflag 's/.*?(?:(\\(?:Answered|Flagged|Deleted|Seen|Draft)\s?)|$)/defined($1)?$1:q()/eg'

Analysis is left to the reader.

This one is longer and may be use with old perl (no /e regex extension):
 --regexflag 's/(.*)/$1 jrdH8u/' \
 --regexflag 's/.*?(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u)/$1 /g' \
 --regexflag 's/(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u) (?!(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u)).*/$1 /g' \
 --regexflag 's/jrdH8u *//'


======================================================================
Q. imapsync fails with the following error:
flags from : [\Seen NonJunk]["10-Aug-2006 13:00:30 -0400"]
Error trying to append string: 58 NO APPEND Invalid flag list

R. For some servers, flags have to begin with a \ character.
The flag "NonJunk" may be a invalid flag for your server 
so use for example:

imapsync ...    --regexflag "s/NonJunk//g"

Remark (thanks to Arnt Gulbrandsen): 
IMAP system flags have to begin with \ character.
Any other flag must begin with another character.
System flags are just flags defined by an RFC instead of by users.
Conclusion, some imap server coders don't read the RFCs (so do I).

Recent imapsync deals with this issue by filter with PERMANENTFLAGS
automatically.

=======================================================================
Q. Flags are not well synchronized. Is it a bug?

R. It happens with some servers on the first sync. 
Also, it was a bug from revision 1.200 to revision 1.207

Two solutions: 

* Run imapsync a second time. imapsync synchronizes flags on each run.

* Use option --syncflagsaftercopy. With this option imapsync will 
  also sync flags after each message transfer. Flags are already 
  synced during the transfer with the imap APPEND command but 
  option --syncflagsaftercopy does it again using the imap STORE 
  command.

=======================================================================
Q. On Unix, some passwords contain * and " characters. Login fails.
R. Use a backslash to escape the characters:

    imapsync ... --password1 \"password\" 

It works for the star * character,
I don't know if it works for the " character.

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, some passwords contain $ characters. Login fails.
R1. Enclose passwords between ""

    imapsync ... --password1 "zzz$zz$$z"

R2. Prefix each $ character with a ^ since ^ is the escape character
    on Windows

    imapsync ... --password1 zzz^$zz^$^$z

For a password that is exactly the 8 characters string $%&<>|^"
you have to enter

    imapsync ... --password1 "$%%&<>|^"^"

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, some passwords begin with an equal = character. 
   Login fails. What can I do?

R. Use twice equals == characters instead; For example, if =secret 
   is the password then use:

    imapsync ... --password1 ==secret

or even

    imapsync ... --password1 "==secret"

=======================================================================
Q. With huge account (many messages) when it comes to reading the
destination server it comes out this error:
"To   Folder [INBOX.foobar] Not connected" 
What can I do?

R. May be spending too much time on the source server, the connection 
timed out on the destination server.
Try options --nofoldersizes 

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync support IMAP TLS?

R. Use --tls1 and/or --tls2 options

--tls1 tells imapsync to use tls on host1.
--tls2 tells imapsync to use tls on host2.


=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync support IMAP over SSL (IMAPS)?

R. Yes natively since release 1.161. 
still, 2 ways, at least :

a) Use native --ssl1 and/or --ssl2 options

--ssl1 tells imapsync to use ssl on host1.
--ssl2 tells imapsync to use ssl on host2.


b) Use stunnel
   http://www.stunnel.org/
   Assuming there is an imaps (993) server on imap.foo.org,
   on your localhost machine (or bar machine) run :
       stunnel -c -d imap -r imap.foo.org:imaps
   or using names instead of numbers 
       stunnel -c -d 143 -r imap.foo.org:993
   then use imapsync on localhost (or bar machine) imap (143) port.
   If the local port 143 is already taken then use a free one, 10143.

c) Other example for gmail with no root access to open port 143

   stunnel -f -P '' -c -d 9993 -r imap.gmail.com:993

Then, to access gmail as host2 use:

  imapsync ... --host2 localhost --port2 9993 --nossl2 

=======================================================================
Q. How can I manually test a login via ssl?

R. Use ncat or telnet-ssl like in this example:

ncat --ssl -C  imap.gmail.com 993
* OK Gimap ready for requests from 78.196.254.58 q1mb175739668wix
a LOGIN "gilles.lamiral@gmail.com" "secret" 
* CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 UNSELECT IDLE NAMESPACE ... ESEARCH
a OK gilles.lamiral@gmail.com Gilles Lamiral authenticated (Success)
b LOGOUT
* BYE LOGOUT Requested
b OK 73 good day (Success)

The client part to type is "a LOGIN ..." and "b LOGOUT" without
the double-quotes. 


=======================================================================
Q: How to have an imaps server?

R. 
a) Install one 

b) or use stunnel :
   Assuming there is an imap (143) server on localhost
        stunnel  -d 993 -r 143 -f

c) or use stunnel on inetd
   imaps stream  tcp nowait cyrus /usr/sbin/stunnel -s cyrus -p /etc/ssl/certs/imapd.pem -r localhost:imap2

=======================================================================
Q: Multiple copies, duplicates, when I run imapsync twice ore more. 

R1. You can use option --useuid, imapsync then won't use header lines to
compare messages in folders. Keep in ming it uses a local cache.

  imapsync ... --useuid

R2. Multiple copies of the emails on the destination server. Some IMAP
servers (Domino for example) change some headers for each message
transferred. All messages are transferred again and again each time you
run imapsync. This is bad of course. The explanation is that imapsync
considers messages are not the same on each side, default headers used
to identify the messages have changed.

You can look at the headers found by imapsync by using the --debug
option (and search for the message on both part), Header lines from
the source server begin with a "FH:" prefix, Header lines from the
destination server begin with a "TH:" prefix. Since --debug is very
verbose I suggest to isolate a email in a specific folder in case you
want to forward me the output.

A way to avoid this problem is by using option --useheader with
a different set than the default ones used by imapsync.

The default set is like:

  imapsync ... --useheader "Message-ID" --useheader "Received"

The big problem is that what can be used instead of Message-ID
and Received lines? Sometimes standalone Message-ID works:

  imapsync ... --useheader "Message-ID"

Another good way to the solution is to isolate two or three messages
in a BUG folder and send the --debug output to the author
gilles.lamiral@laposte.net

  imapsync ... --debug  --folder BUG

I will take a close look at the log and modify imapsync to fix
this faulty duplicate behaviour.

Remark. (Trick found by Tomasz Kaczmarski)

Option --useheader "Message-ID" asks the server to send only header
lines beginning with "Message-ID".  Some (buggy) servers send the whole
header (all lines) instead of the "Message-ID" line. In that case, a
trick to keep the --useheader filtering behaviour is to use
--skipheader with a negative lookahead pattern :

 imapsync ... --skipheader "^(?!Message-ID)"

 Read it as "skip every header except Message-ID".

======================================================================
Q. I am transferring mails from one IMAP server to another. I am using
   an SSL connection. Transferring huge mails (>10MB) takes ages.

R. try to transfer the mails without SSL connection. SSL code outside
   imapsync uses a memory buffer, which gets increased upon reading of
   mails by 4096 bytes. This creates a huge load on the host imapsync
   runs on by copying the memory buffers for every 4096 byte step.
   This does not occur without SSL.

(Written by Stefan Schmidt)

======================================================================
Q. What are --subscribe and --subscribed for, and how can they be used?

R. In the IMAP protocol each user can subscribe to one or more folders.
   Then he can configure its email software to just see his subscribed
   folders list. That's an IMAP feature.

   Knowing that, the imapsync help says:

  imapsync --help
  ...
  --subscribed           : transfers subscribed folders.
  --subscribe            : subscribe to the folders transferred on the 
                           host2 that are subscribed on host1.
  --subscribe_all        : subscribe to the folders transferred on the 
                           host2 even if they are not subscribed on host1.


======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude a folder hierarchy like "public"

R. Use:

--exclude "^public\."
or maybe
--exclude '^"public\.'

In the example given the character "." is the folder separator, you
can omit it. Just take the string as it appears on the imapsync
output line :

From folders list : [INBOX] [public.dreams] [etc.]


======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude only INBOX

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --exclude "^INBOX$" 

A good way to see what will be done is to first use:

  imapsync ...  --exclude "^INBOX$" --justfolders --nofoldersizes --dry


======================================================================
Q. Can Imapsync filter Spam during the sync?

R. No, imapsync doesn't detect Spam by itself and currently it can't
delegate this job during its IMAP syncs. But I've seen blogs and
Spamassassin documentation explaining solutions to apply Spamassassin
to a imap mailbox. So you can apply one of these solutions on the host1
source mailbox before the imapsync run or on the destination host2
mailbox after the imapsync transfer.

http://www.stearns.org/doc/spamassassin-setup.current.html#isbg
http://euer.krebsco.de/using-spamassassin-on-a-remote-imap-host.html
https://github.com/ook/isbg

======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude folders matching SPAM no matter the case, 
   aka how to be case insensitive

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --exclude "(?i)spam" 

A good way to see what will be done is to first use:

  imapsync ... --exclude "(?i)spam" --justfolders --nofoldersizes --dry


======================================================================
Q. I want the --folder "MyFolder" option be recursive.

Two solutions:

R1. Use

--folderrec "MyFolder"

R2. Use --include "^MyFolder"
   Then the folder "MyFolder" and all its subfolders will be handled
   and only them.


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from uw-imap with an admin/authuser account?

R. Use the following syntax:

  imapsync ... --user1="loginuser*admin_user" --password1 "admin_user_password"


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate to Dovecot with an admin/MasterUser account?

R. Dovecot uses the same syntax as uw-imap

  imapsync ... --user2="loginuser*admin_user" --password2 "admin_user_password"

To setup a Dovecot MasterUser see 
http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/MasterUsers

======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from cyrus with an admin account?

R. Use:
 
 imapsync ... \
   --authuser1 admin_user  ----password1 admin_user_password \
   --user1 foo_user --ssl1

Instead of --ssl1 the alternative --tls1 can be used.
With --authuser1, the option --authmech1 PLAIN is set
automatically, you don't have to add it.

PLAIN authentication is the only way to go with --authuser1 for now.
So don't use --authmech1 SOMETHING with --authuser1 admin_user,
it will not work.
Same behavior with the --authuser2 option.

Do not forget the option --ssl1 or --tls1 since PLAIN auth is only
supported with ssl encryption most of the time. But it can
work without --ssl1 nor --tls1 if PLAIN is permitted in clear text
transmissions (the normal mode).

Add the AdminAccount to admins line in /etc/imapd.conf
Give AdminAccount lrswipkxtecda to the Cyrus Imap account 
being migrated from, "joe" here.


Here is an example:
 imapsync \
	--host1 server1 \
	--user1 joe \
	--authuser1 AdminAccount \
	--password1 AdminAccountPassword \
	--ssl1 \
	--host2 server2 \
	--user2 joe \
	--password2 joespassonserver2 \
	--exclude "^user\."

======================================================================
Q: How to migrate from Sun Java Enterprise System / Sun One / iPlanet /
Netscape servers with an admin account?

R: Those imap servers don't allow the typical use of --authuser1 to use an
administrative account. They expect the use of an IMAP command called
proxyauth that is issued after login in as an administrative account.

For example, consider the administrative account 'administrator' and your
real user 'real_user'. The IMAP sequence would be:

  OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS
  CHILDREN BINARY UNSELECT LANGUAGE STARTTLS XSENDER X-NETSCAPE XSERVERINFO
  AUTH=PLAIN] imap.server IMAP4 service (Sun Java(tm) System Messaging
  Server ...))
  1 LOGIN administrator password
  1 OK User logged in
  2 PROXYAUTH real_user
  2 OK Completed

In imapsync, you can achieve this by using the following options:

  --host1 source.imap.server \
  --user1 real_user \
  --authuser1 administrator \
  --proxyauth1 \
  --passfile admin.txt

======================================================================
Q. Is there anyway of making imapsync purge the destination folder
   when the source folder is deleted?

R. No, that's too dangerous. May be coded in future release.

But if the source folder is empty (not deleted) and options --delete2
--expunge2 are used then the destination folder will be empty.

======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to synchronize all messages from one server to 
another without recreating the folder structure and the target server.

R. Yes.

For example, to synchronize all messages in all folders on host1
to folder INBOX only on host2:

1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 "s/(.*)/INBOX/" \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side, you should
   only have one: the classical INBOX.

4) Remove --justfolders


======================================================================
Q. I have moved from Braunschweig to Graz, so I would like to have my
   whole Braunschweig mail sorted into a sub-folder INBOX.Braunschweig 
   of my new mail account.

R.
1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 "s/INBOX(.*)/INBOX.Braunschweig\$1/" \
 --dry --justfolders

On Windows, in the previous example containing \$1 you have to 
replace the two \$1 by $1 (remove the \ before $).


2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side

4) Remove --justfolders

=======================================================================
Q. Give examples about --regextrans2

R. --regextrans2 is used to transform folder names

Remember that --regextrans2 applies after the default 
inversion prefix1 <-> prefix2 and sep1 <-> sep2

Examples: 

0) First try with --dry --justfolders options since imapsync shows the
   transformations it will do without really doing them. Then when
   happy with the output remove the --dry --justfolders options.

1) To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:

    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'

2a) To sync all folders to INBOX:

  imapsync ... --regextrans2 "s/.*/INBOX/"


2b) To sync a complete account in a subfolder called FOO:
  
  a) Seperator is dot character "." and "INBOX" prefixes every folder
  
    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

  or:
  
  b) Seperator is slash character "/" and there is no prefix 
  
   --regextrans2 's#(.*)#FOO/$1#'
   
   or:

  c) Any separator, any prefix solution, FOO is the subfolder:

  It is a complicated line because every case is taken into account.
  Type it in one line (or with the \ at the end of first line on Unix shells.
   
   --regextrans2 's,${h2_prefix}(.*),${h2_prefix}FOO${h2_sep}$1,' \
   --regextrans2 's,^INBOX$,${h2_prefix}FOO{h2_sep}INBOX,'


3) to substitute all characters dot "." by underscores "_"
    --regextrans2 's/\./_/g'

4) to change folder names like this:
[mail/Sent Items] -> [Sent]
[mail/Test]       -> [INBOX/Test]
[mail/Test2]      -> [INBOX/Test2]

    --regextrans2 's#^mail/Sent Items$#Sent#' \
    --regextrans2 's#^mail/#INBOX/#'

=======================================================================
Q. I would like to move emails from InBox to a sub-folder called,
   say "2010-INBOX" based on the date (Like all emails received in the
   Year 2010 should be moved to the folder called "2010-INBOX").

R. 2 ways :

a) Manually:
------------

1) You create a folder INBOX.2010-INBOX

2) Mostly every email software allow sorting by date. In INBOX, you
   select from 1 January to 31 December 2010 messages with the shift key.
   (in mutt, use ~d)

3) Cut/paste in INBOX.2010-INBOX

b) With imapsync:
-----------------

imapsync ... \
--search 'SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010'
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX$/INBOX.2010-INBOX/' \
--folder INBOX

=======================================================================
Q. I want to play with headers line and --regexmess but I want to leave
   the body as is

R. The header/body separation is a blank line so an example:
   --regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?! ^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nX-Date:$2}gxms'

Will replace (HeaderBegin and HeaderEnd are not part of the header)

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

by

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
X-Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

This example just add an header line "X-Date:" based on "Date:" line.

=======================================================================
Q. My imap server does not accept a message and warns
   "Invalid header". What is the problem?

R. You fall in the classical mbox versus Maildir/ format
   problem. May be you use a misconfigured procmail rule.

A header beginning like the following one is in the mbox
format, header line 1 has no colon behind "From", header
lines 2 through N do have a colon :

From foo@yoyo.org  Sat Jun 22 01:10:21 2002
Return-Path: <foo@yoyo.org>
Received: ...

Any Maildir/ configured imap server may refuse this message since its
header is invalid. The first "From " line is not valid. It lacks a
colon character ":". To solve this issue you have several solutions

a) Remove manually this first "From " line for each message before
   using imapsync. 

b) Replace manually the whitespace by a colon in string "From " but you
   might end with two "From:" lines (just have a look at the other 
   header lines of the message)

c) Run imapsync with the following option (this replaces "From "by "From:"):
   --regexmess 's/\AFrom /From:/'

or may be better (no other "From:" collision):

d) Run imapsync with the following option (this replaces "From "by "X-om:"):
   --regexmess 's/\AFrom /X-om:/'

e) Run imapsync with the following option (this removes the whole "From " line):
   --regexmess 's{\AFrom\ [^\n]*(\n)?}{}gxms'

Solution e) is solution a) made by imapsync itself.
Solutions c) and d) keep "From " lines information
(normally it's useless to keep them)

Best solutions are e) or d).

=======================================================================
Q. The contact folder isn't well copied. 
   How to copy the contact folder?

R. Forget the destination server (choose the same)
Change the script around line 1426
       # ITSD
       $new_id = $from->copy($t_fold,$f_msg);
       #$new_id = $to->append_string($t_fold,$string, $flags_f, $d);

and tried a copy of the mail instead an append_string. Because we are
using the same server, we can use $from->copy Therefore we seem to not
download and upload the message and therefore we do not have any
format issues. And now it works fine. (Thanks to Hansjoerg.Maurer)

Q. From Zimbra to XXX

imapsync ... \
	--exclude "Conversation Action Settings" \
	--exclude "Quick Step Settings" \
	--exclude "News Feed"

=======================================================================
Q. From or to HMailServer version 4.4.1.

R. You have to add prefix and separator manually because  4.4.1 doesn't
honor the NAMESPACE imap command.

Example for host1:

imapsync ... \
         --prefix1 "" --sep1 .

No specific option for HMailServer 5.3.3 since NAMESPACE is supported.

Maybe --subscribe_all will help you to see all migrated folders.

        --sep1 '/'

Can also add --ssl1 to gain encrypted transfer from yahoo.
SSL seems to be mandatory for yahoo (since november 2011)

Q. Syncing from Google Apps domain to Googlemail account

A known bug encountered with this output (Alexander is a folder name):

++++ Verifying [Alexander] -> [Alexander] ++++
+ NO msg #16 [A96Dh4AwlLVphOAW5MS/eQ:779824] in Alexander
+ Copying msg #16:779824 to folder Alexander
flags from : [\Seen]["04-Jul-2007 14:32:22 +0100"]
Couldn't append msg #16 (Subject:[Rieter-Event    (please accept with
comments)]) to folder Alexander: 46 NO Invalid folder: Sent (Failure)

In fact folder "Sent" is just the last folder listed previously
as a:
...
To   Folder [Sent]                             does not exist yet
To   Folder [Sonja]                             Size:   1024546 Messages:    96
...

R. Just run imapsync a time like this :
imapsync ... --folder Alexander

Q. Migrating from or to Parallels Plex Server

R. It depends on the OS

Parallells Plesk Panel for Windows requires --sep2 / --prefix2 ""
Parallells Plesk Panel for Linux works with default parameters.

Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail but the tool copies everything in /home/user, how
   can i avoid that?

Two solutions:

R. Use
   imapsync ... --include '^mail'

R. or (better)
   imapsync ... --subscribed --subscribe


=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail directory.  When imapsync creates the folders in
   the new cyrus imap server, it makes a folder "mail" and below that
   folder puts all the mail folders the user have in /home/user/mail,
   i would like to have all those folders directly under INBOX.

R. Use 
   imapsync ... --regextrans2 's/^mail/INBOX/' --dry
   look at the simulation and if all transformations seem
   good then remove the --dry option.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Groupwise to Cyrus

R. By Jamie Neil:

I eventually managed to get the mail to migrate without errors using the 
following options:

--sep1 /
  - doesn't report separator so has to be set explicitly.

--nosyncacls
  - doesn't support ACLs.

--skipheader '^Content-Type'
  - MIME separator IDs seem to change every time a mail is accessed so 
    this is required to stop duplicates.

--maxage 3650
  - some messages just don't seem to want to transfer and produce the 
    perl errors I mentioned before. This prevents the errors, but the
    bad messages don't transfer.

Even though the mail migrated OK, there are a couple of gotchas with 
Groupwise IMAP:

1) Some of the GW folders are not real folders and are not available
to IMAP, the main problem one being "Sent Items". I could find no way
of coping the contents of these folders. The nearest I got was to
create a "real" folder and copy/move the sent items into it, but
imapsync still didn't see the messages (I think because there is
something funny about the reported dates/sizes).

It think this problem has been rectified in GW6.5.

2) The "skipheader '^Content-Type'" directive is required to stop 
duplicate messages being created. GW seems to generate this field on
the fly for messages that have MIME separators and so it's different
every time.

3) Version 6.0.1 of the Groupwise Internet Connector sucks. I was 
getting server aborts when I pushed it a bit hard! I eventually had to
upgrade to 6.0.4 which seems to be a lot more stable.

Q. Migrating from iPlanet Messaging Server
5.2 Patch 2 (built Jul 14 2004)) to Groupwise 7.0
I encounter many errors like this:
"Error trying to append string: 17847 BAD APPEND"

R. GroupWise 7 seems buggy. Apply GroupWise 7 support pack 1

Q. Migrating from David Tobit V10 (DvISE Mail Access Server MA-...)

R. Use the following options:

imapsync ... --prefix1 ""    --sep1 /  --idatefromheader ^
             --nofoldersizes --useuid --nocheckmessageexists

=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from David Tobit V8
   ("* OK IMAP4rev1 DvISE Mail Access Server MA-8.10a (0126)")

First try above V10 solution since improvments have been made
to support Tobit.

R. Use the following options :
imapsync ... --prefix1 INBOX. --sep1 / --subscribe --subscribed 

=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Tobit David Server 6 
   ("DvISE Mail Access Server MA-6.60a (0118)")

First try above V10 solution since improvments have been made
to support Tobit.

R. Look at the discussion:

=======================================================================
Q. I need to migrate 1250 mailboxes, passwords are in a MySQL Database.
Can you tell me if your script suits my needs?

R. Mailboxes must exist before running imapsync.
You have to extract users logins and passwords in a csv file.
See the "HUGE MIGRATION" section in the README file.


======================================================================
Q: From MailEnable 1.75
R: --sep1 "/" --prefix1 ""

Q: From MailEnable 2.2
R: --sep1 "." --prefix1 ""

Q: To MailEnable
R: --sep2 / --prefix2 "" --addheader --messageidnodomain --syncflagsaftercopy

======================================================================
Q. From GMX IMAP4 StreamProxy
R. Use:
   --prefix1 INBOX and --sep1 .

======================================================================
Q. From Courier to Archiveopteryx
R. You can read http://www.archiveopteryx.org/migration/imapsync
   Default values might be fine now with latest imapsync.

Q. From Softalk Workgroup Mail 7.6.4 

R. Old Softalk releases don't support the IMAP SEARCH command.
   Here are the options to get it working.

imapsync ... --sep1 '.' --prefix1 '' \
             --noabletosearch  --nocheckmessageexists --addheader

(Thanks to Andrew Tucker)

======================================================================
Q. From or to QQMail IMAP4Server

R. imapsync ... --noabletosearch

======================================================================
Q. From FirstClass to XXX
   http://www.firstclass.com/

R. Migrating from FirstClass is not easy because FirstClass, strangely, 
   does not show all messages via IMAP. To make it show all messages,
   a trick, painful to follow by hand, is moving emails 
   out and back in, for each folder. May be it can be done by a script.

  FirstClass releases prior to release 12 do not shows the "Sent" 
  folder in IMAP but FirstClass release 12 shows it.
  I advice you to upgrade to FirstClass release 12 before leaving it
  with imapsync or another imap tool.

Here is a command line used to migrate from FirtClass release 12:

  imapsync ... \
    --tmpdir /var/tmp --usecache \
    --useheader Message-ID \
    --idatefromheader \
    --addheader \
    --regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,\$1,g" --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),\$1,g" \
    --regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g"       \
    --regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g"  \
    --regextrans2 "s,&AC8-,-,g" \
    --regextrans2 "s,&APg-,oe,g" 

On Windows, in the previous example containing \$1 you have to 
replace the two \$1 by $1 (remove the \ before $).

Special thanks to Kristian Wind and Joey Alexander for helping me
writing this FAQ item.

======================================================================
Q. From XXX to FTGate

R. Do NOT use --usecache since new UIDs are not given by FTGate and also
   badly guessed by imapsync. UIDEXPUNGE does not work so use also
   --expunge2 when using --delete2
  
  imapsync ... \
     --sep2 / --prefix2 "" \
     --useheader Message-Id \


======================================================================
Q: How can I write an .rpm with imapsync

R. You'll find an RPM imapsync.spec file in the directory learn/rpm/
   It has been downloaded from
   https://svn.fysik.dtu.dk/projects/rpmbuild/trunk/SPECS/imapsync.spec
   It has been tested with imapsync 1.434 (May 2011) on CentOS5 
   and RedHat RHEL5 Linux. (Thanks to Ole Holm Nielsen).
   This imapsync.spec is coming from Neil Brown work in 2007.
