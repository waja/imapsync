Q. Where I can find old imapsync releases ?

R. ftp://www.linux-france.org/pub/prj/imapsync/

=======================================================================
Q. How can I try imapsync with Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx perl library?

R. - Download latest Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx at
   http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/
   - untar it anywhere:
        tar xzvf Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx.tar.gz

   - Download latest imapsync at
   http://lamiral.info/~gilles/imapsync/imapsync

   - run imapsync with perl and -I option tailing to use Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx
     and add also option --allow3xx:
       perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.16/lib  imapsync ... --allow3xx 

=======================================================================
Q. imapsync does not work with Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx
   How can I downgrade to 2.2.9 release?

R. - Download Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 at 
   http://search.cpan.org/~djkernen/Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9/
   http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DJ/DJKERNEN/Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9.tar.gz
   - untar it anywhere:
        tar xzvf Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9.tar.gz
   - run imapsync with perl and -I option tailing to use Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9:
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9 imapsync [...]
     or if imapsync is in directory /path/
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9 /path/imapsync [...]



=======================================================================
Q. I am interested in creating  a local clone of the IMAP on a LAN 
server for  faster synchronisations, Email will always be delivered 
to the remote server and so the synchronisation will be one way from 
remote to local. How suited is ImapSync to continouous one-way 
synchronisation of mailboxes? Is there a better solution?

R. If messages are delivered remotely and you play locally with the
copy, in order to have fast access, then the synchronisation can't
be one way. You may change flags, you may move messages in 
different folders etc.

A better tool with this scenario is offlineimap, 
designed for this issue, and faster than imapsync.

=======================================================================
Q. We have found that the sent time and date have been changed to the 
   time at which the file was synchronised. 

R. This is the case with:
   - Eudora
   - Zimbra
   - Outlook 2003
   - Gmail
   but not with 
   - Mutt
   - Thunderbird

Eurora shows by default the time the imap server received the email.
I think it is quite a wrong behavior since the messages can
have travelled some time before the reception.

The sent time and date are given by the "Date:" header
and it is set most of the time by the MUA (Mail User Agent, 
Mutt, Eudora, Thunderbird etc.).

imapsync does not touch any header since the
header is used to identify the messages in
both parts.

Solutions: 
a) Don't use buggy Eudora.
b) Use the --syncinternaldates option and keep using Eudora :-)
c) Use the script learn/adjust_time.pl to change the internal dates
   from the "Date:" header.

=======================================================================
Q. The option --subscribe does not seem to work

R. Use it with --subscribed

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync retain the \Answered and $Forwarded flags?

R. imapsync retains all flags except \Recent 
(RFC 3501 says "This flag can not be altered by the client.")

Some imap servers have problems with flags not beginning with
the backslash character \ 

======================================================================
Q. imapsync fails with the following error:
flags from : [\Seen NonJunk]["10-Aug-2006 13:00:30 -0400"]
Error trying to append string: 58 NO APPEND Invalid flag list

R. For some servers, flags have to begin with a \ character.
The flag "NonJunk" may be a invalid flag for your server 
so use for example:

imapsync ...    --regexflag 's/NonJunk//g'

Remark (thanks to Arnt Gulbrandsen): 
IMAP system flags have to begin with \ character.
Any other flag must begin with another character.
System flags are just flags defined by an RFC instead of by users.
Conclusion, some imap server coders don't read the RFCs (so do I).

=======================================================================
Q. Flags are not well synchonized. Is it a bug ?

R. It happens with some servers on the first sync. 
Also, it was a bug from revision 1.200 to revision 1.207

Solution: run imapsync a second time. imapsync synchronizes flags
on each run unless option --fast is used.

Q. imapsync hangs taking up 99.8% cpu right after start, 
   after printing imapd doesn't support MD5 auth.

R. Try option --noauthmd5

=======================================================================
Q. Some passwords contain * and " characters. Login fails.
R. Use

    imapsync --password1 \"password\" 

Ii works for the star * character,
I don't know if it works for the " character.

=======================================================================
Q. Out of memory on FreeBSD

R. http://groups.google.com/group/lucky.freebsd.questions/browse_thread/thread/f4218e4252863328

See the user limit with the command
    ulimit -a
To change it, try 
    ulimit -d 1000000000  
Also
http://www.unixadmintalk.com/f41/perl-out-memory-sbrk-9112/
The default hard datasize limit on FreeBSD is 512MB. To raise it, put this 
(or more) in /boot/loader.conf and reboot:

kern.maxdsiz="1024M"

=======================================================================
Q. With huge account (many messages) when it comes to reading the
destination server it comes out this error:
"To   Folder [INBOX.foobar] Not connected" 
What can I do ?

R. May be spending too much time on the source server, the connection 
timed out on the destination server.
Try options :
  --nofoldersizes --useheader Message-ID --fast

=======================================================================
Q. imapsync failed with a "word too long" error from the imap server,
   What can I do ?

R. Use imapsync release 1.172 or at least 1.166 with options
   --split1 500 --split2 500
   or a old old imapsync (before 1.94)

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync support IMAP over TLS (IMAPS)?

R. Yes natively since release 1.161. 
still, 2 ways, at least :

a) Use --ssl1 and/or --ssl2 options

--ssl1 tells imapsync to use ssl on host1
--ssl2 tells imapsync to use ssl on host2


b) Use stunnel
   http://www.stunnel.org/
   Assuming there is an imaps (993) server on imap.foo.org,
   on your localhost machine (or bar machine) run :
       stunnel -c -d imap -r imap.foo.org:imaps
   or using names instead of numbers 
       stunnel -c -d 143 -r imap.foo.org:993
   then use imapsync on localhost (or bar machine) imap (143) port.


=======================================================================
Q: How to have an imaps server ?

R. 
a) Install one 

b) or use stunnel :
   Assuming there is an imap (143) server on localhost
        stunnel  -d 993 -r 143 -f

c) or use stunnel on inetd
   imaps stream  tcp nowait cyrus /usr/sbin/stunnel -s cyrus -p /etc/ssl/certs/imapd.pem -r localhost:imap2

=======================================================================
Q: I'm trying to use imapsync on win32 for gmail, but it requires ssl, 
or at least  claims to. Imapsync appears to require io-socket-ssl, 
which doesn't seem to be available on win32. Are there any other options?

R: (Q and R come as is from Bryce Walter)
I think I'm having success using cygwin perl instead of
ActiveState Perl. I wasn't able to get CPAN working and
building IO::Socket::SSL in ActiveState, but cygwin did
all right. I had to force the install of the Net::SSLeay
dependency, because it partially failed one test, but I think
it worked anyway. In order to get working in cygwin, I
installed the entire "perl" category, lynx, ncftp, and lftp
(specified as ftp program in cpan setup). I'm not sure if I
needed all those, or if cpan just kept asking because I didn't
have any installed at the time. Anyway, cpan worked, and
I installed all dependencies that imapsync complained
about until it started working. 

=======================================================================
Q: Multiple copies when I run imapsync twice ore more.

R. Multiple copies of the emails on the destination
server. Some IMAP servers (Domino for example) add some
headers for each message transfered. The message is
transfered again and again each time you run imapsync. This
is bad of course. The explanation is that imapsync considers
the message is not the same since headers have changed (one
line added) and size too (the header part). 

You can look at the headers found by imapsync by using the 
--debug option (and search for the message on both part),
Header lines from the source server begin with a "FH:" prefix,
Header lines from the destination server begin with a "TH:" prefix.
Since --debug is very verbose I suggest to isolate a 
email in a specific folder in case you want to forward
me the output.

The way to avoid this problem is by using options --skipheader and
--skipsize, like this (avoid headers beginning whith the
string "X-"):

 imapsync ... --skipheader '^X-' --skipsize

To skip several headers you can use --skipheader one time

 imapsync ... --skipheader '^X-|^Status|^Bcc'

If you think you have too many header to avoid just use

 imapsync ... --useheader 'Message-ID' --skipsize

Remark. (Trick found by Tomasz Kaczmarski)
Option --useheader 'Message-ID' asks the server
to send only header lines begining with 'Message-ID'. 
Some (buggy) servers send the whole header (all lines)
instead of the 'Message-ID' line. In that case, a trick
to keep the --useheader filtering behavior is to use
--skipheader with a negative lookahead pattern :

 imapsync ... --skipheader '^(?!Message-ID)' --skipsize

 Read it as "skip every header except Message-ID".

======================================================================
Q. I am transferring mails from one IMAP server to another. I am using
   an SSL connection. Transferring huge mails (>10MB) takes ages.

R. try to transfer the mails without SSL connection. SSL code outside
   imapsync uses a memory buffer, which gets increased upon reading of
   mails by 4096 bytes. This creates a huge load on the host imapsync
   runs on by copying the memory buffers for every 4096 byte step.
   This does not occur without SSL.

(Written by Stefan Schmidt)

======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude a folder hierarchy like "public"

R. Use

--exclude '^public\.'
or maybe
--exclude '^"public\.'

In the example given the character "." is the folder separator,
you can ommit it. Just take the string as it appears on the
imapsync output line :

From folders list : [INBOX] [public.dreams] [etc.]

======================================================================
Q. I want the --folder 'MyFolder' option be recurse.

R. Do not use the --folder option. 
   Instead, use --include '^MyFolder'
   Then the folder "MyFolder" and all its subfolders will be handled
   and only them.

R. Use 

--folderrec 'MyFolder'


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from uw-imap with an admin/authuser account ?

R. Use 
--user1="user*admin_user" --password1 "admin_user_password"


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from cyrus with an admin account ?

R. Use 
--authuser1 admin_user  ----password1 admin_user_password \
 --user1 foo_user --ssl1

In this case, --authmech1 PLAIN will be used by default since it
is the only way to go for now. So don't use --authmech1 SOMETHING
with --authuser1 admin_user, it will not work.
Same behavior with the --authuser2 option.

Do not forget the option --ssl1 since PLAIN auth is only
supported with ssl encryption most of the time. But it can
work without --ssl1 if PLAIN is permitted in normal use.

Here is an example:
 imapsync \
	--host1 server1 \
	--user1 joe \
	--authuser1 AdminAccount \
	--password1 AdminAccountPassword \
	--ssl1 \
	--host2 server2 \
	--user2 joe \
	--password2 joespassonserver2 \
	--exclude '^user\.'

======================================================================
Q. Is anyway imapsync to purge destionation folder when the source
   folder is deleted?

R. No, that's too much dangerous.
But if the source folder is empty (not deleted) and 
options --delete2 --expunge2 are used then 
the destination folder will be empty.

======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to synchronize all messages from one server to 
another whithout recreating the folder structure and the target server.

R. Yes.
1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 's/(.*)/INBOX/' \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side, you should
   only have one : the classical INBOX.

4) Remove --justfolders


======================================================================
Q. I have moved from Braunschweig to Graz, so I would like to have my whole 
Braunschweig mail sorted into a folder INBOX.Braunschweig of my new mail 
account.

R.
1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 's/INBOX(.*)/INBOX.Braunschweig$1/' \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side

4) Remove --justfolders

=======================================================================
Q. Give examples about --regextrans2

R. Examples: 

0) First try with --dry --justfolders options since imapsync shows the 
transformations it will do without really doing them. Then when happy 
with the output remove the --dry --justfolders options.

1) To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:
    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'

2) To sync a complete account in a subfolder called FOO:
  
  a) Separator is dot character "." and "INBOX" prefixes every folder
    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

  Or
  b) Separator is slash character "/" 
   --regextrans2 's#(.*)#FOO/$1#'

3) to substitute all characters dot "." by underscores "_"
    --regextrans2 's/\./_/g'

=======================================================================
Q. I would like to move emails from InBox to a sub-folder
called , say "2005-InBox" based on the date (Like all emails
received in the Year 2005 should be moved to the folder
called "2005-InBox").

R. 2 ways :

a) Manually:
------------

1) You create a folder INBOX.2005-INBOX
2) Mostly every email software allow sorting by date.
In inbox, you select from 1 january to 31 december
messages with the shift key.
3) Cut/paste in INBOX.2005-INBOX

b) With imapsync:
-----------------

You have to calculate the day of year (and
add 365).  For example, running it today, 
Sat Mar 11 13:06:01 CET 2006:

imapsync ... 
--host1 imap.truc.org --host2 imap.trac.org \
--user1 foo --user2 foo  \
...
--maxage 435 --minage 70 \
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX$/INBOX.2005-INBOX/' \
--folder INBOX


To know the day of year:

$ date
Sat Mar 11 13:06:01 CET 2006

$ date +%j
070

Also, you must take imapsync 1.159 at least since I tested
what I just wrote above and found 2 bugs about --mindate
--maxdate options behavior.

=======================================================================
Q. I want to play with headers line and --regexmess but I want to leave
   the body as is

R. The header/body separation is a blank line so an example:
   --regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?! ^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nX-Date:$2}gxms'

Will replace 

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

by

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
X-Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

This example just add an header line "X-Date:" based on "Date:" line.

=======================================================================
Q. My imap server does not accept a message and warns
   "Invalid header". What is the problem ?

R. You fall in the classical mbox versus Maildir/ format
   problem. May be you use a misconfigured procmail rule.

A header beginning like the following one is in the mbox
format, header line 1 has no colon behind "From", header
lines 2 through N do have a colon :

From foo@yoyo.org  Sat Jun 22 01:10:21 2002
Return-Path: <foo@yoyo.org>
Received: ...

Any Maidir/ configured imap server may refuse this message
since its header is invalid. The first "From " line is not
valid. It lacks a colon character ":".
To solve this problem you have several solutions a) or b):

a) Remove these first "From " line manually for each message
before using imapsync. Don't think to add a colon to this
line since you will end with two "From:" lines (just look at
the other lines)

b) Run imapsync with the following options :
--regexmess 's/\AFrom \w  .*\n//'  --skipsize

=======================================================================
Q. The contact folder isn't well copied. 
   How to copy the contact folder ?

R. Forget the destination server (chose the same)
Change the script around line 1426
       # ITSD
       $new_id = $from->copy($t_fold,$f_msg);
       #$new_id = $to->append_string($t_fold,$string, $flags_f, $d);
and tried a copy of the mail instead an append_string.
Because we are using the same server, we can use $from->copy
Therefore we seem to not download and upload the message and therefore
we do not have any format issues.
And now it works fine.
(Thanks to Hansjoerg.Maurer)


=======================================================================
Q. Synchronysing from XXX to Gmail

R. There are some details to get the special [Gmail]
sub-folders right. Here's an example of migrating an old "Sent"
folder to Gmail's structure:

imapsync --syncinternaldates \
         --host1 mail.oldhost.com \
         --user1 my_email@oldhost.com \
         --password1 password \
         --host2 imap.gmail.com --port2 993 --ssl2 \
         --user2 my_email@gmail.com \
         --password2 password \
         --useheader 'Message-Id'  --skipsize \
         --prefix2 '[Gmail]/' \
         --folder 'INBOX.Sent' \
         --regextrans2 's/Sent/Sent Mail/'

The same goes for the "All Mail" archive psuedo-folder.

=======================================================================
Q. Synchronysing from Gmail to XXX

R. Gmail needs ssl. 

./imapsync \
           --host1 imap.gmail.com --ssl1 \
           --user1 gilles.lamiral@gmail.com \
           --passfile1 /var/tmp/secret.gilles_gmail \
           --host2 localhost
           --user2 tata@est.belle \
           --passfile2 /var/tmp/secret.tata \
           --useheader 'Message-Id'  --skipsize 

If your destination imap server doesn't like "[Gmail]" name, just add
option:
           --regextrans2 's/\[Gmail\]/Gmail/'


=======================================================================
Q. migrate email from gmail to google apps

R. Take a look at:
http://biasecurities.com/2009/migrate-email-from-gmail-to-google-apps/
http://www.thamtech.com/blog/2008/03/29/gmail-to-google-apps-email-migration/

=======================================================================
Q. from Microsoft's Exchange 2007 to Google Apps for your Domain 
   (GAFYD)

R. Take a look at:
http://mark.ossdl.de/2009/02/migrating-from-exchange-2007-to-google-apps-mail/

=======================================================================
Q. Syncing from Google Apps domain to Googlemail account

A known bug encountered with this output (Alexander is a folder name):
++++ Verifying [Alexander] -> [Alexander] ++++
+ NO msg #16 [A96Dh4AwlLVphOAW5MS/eQ:779824] in Alexander
+ Copying msg #16:779824 to folder Alexander
flags from : [\Seen]["04-Jul-2007 14:32:22 +0100"]
Couldn't append msg #16 (Subject:[Rieter-Event    (please accept with
comments)]) to folder Alexander: 46 NO Invalid folder: Sent (Failure)

In fact folder "Sent" is just the last folder listed previously
as a:
...
To   Folder [Sent]                             does not exist yet
To   Folder [Sonja]                             Size:   1024546 Messages:    96
...

R. Just run imapsync a time like this :
imapsync ... --folder Alexander

=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are
under /home/user/mail but the tool copies everything in
/home/user, how can i avoid that?

R. Use
   imapsync ... --include '^mail'
or (better)
   imapsync ... --subscribed --subscribe


=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are
under /home/user/mail directory.  When imapsync creates the
folders in the new cyrus imap server, it makes a folder
"mail" and below that folder puts all the mail folders the
user have in /home/user/mail, i would like to have all those
folders directly under INBOX.

R. Use 
   imapsync ... --regextrans2 's/^mail/INBOX/' --dry
   look at the simulation and if all transformations seem
   good then remove the --dry option.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Groupwise to Cyrus

R. By Jamie Neil:

I eventually managed to get the mail to migrate without errors using the 
following options:

--sep1 /
  - doesn't report separator so has to be set explicitly.

--nosyncacls
  - doesn't support ACLs.

--skipheader '^Content-Type'
  - MIME separator IDs seem to change every time a mail is accessed so 
this is required to stop duplicates.

--maxage 3650
  - some messages just don't seem to want to transfer and produce the 
perl errors I mentioned before. This prevents the errors, but the bad 
messages don't transfer.

Even though the mail migrated OK, there are a couple of gotchas with 
Groupwise IMAP:

1) Some of the GW folders are not real folders and are not available to 
IMAP, the main problem one being "Sent Items". I could find no way of 
coping the contents of these folders. The nearest I got was to create a 
"real" folder and copy/move the sent items into it, but imapsync still 
didn't see the messages (I think because there is something funny about 
the reported dates/sizes).
It think this problem has been rectified in GW6.5.

2) The "skipheader '^Content-Type'" directive is required to stop 
duplicate messages being created. GW seems to generate this field on the 
fly for messages that have MIME separators and so it's different every time.

3) Version 6.0.1 of the Groupwise Internet Connector sucks. I was 
getting server abends when I pushed it a bit hard! I eventually had to 
upgrade to 6.0.4 which seems to be a lot more stable.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from iPlanet Messaging Server
5.2 Patch 2 (built Jul 14 2004)) to Groupwise 7.0
I encounter many errors like this:
"Error trying to append string: 17847 BAD APPEND"

R. GroupWise 7 seems buggy. Apply GroupWise 7 support pack 1


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from David Tobit V8

R. Use the following options :
imapsync ... --prefix1 INBOX. --sep1 / --subscribe --subscribed

Q. I need to migrate 1250 mailboxes from one cyrus-IMAP server to another
(empty) one. (Box-swap). The passwords are in a MySQL Database.
Can you tell me if your script suits my needs?

R. Partially, mailboxes must exist before running imapsync.
May be, Box-swap is not listed in "Failure stories"
nor "Success stories" in the README file.
You have to extract user and password in a csv file.
See the "HUGE MIGRATION" section in the README file.

Q. From Cyrus to Notes

Juhu! --useheader 'Message-ID' --skipsize does wonders! :)

Q. From cyrus to dbmail

R. (Given by Michael Monnerie, left as is)

dbmail creates a header like
X-DBMail-PhysMessage-ID:94348
on messages. There was another problem with cyrus, other headers get 
modified also, so I recommend this for a full sync:

imapsync --host1 cyrushost  --user1 u1 --password1 p1 \
         --host2 dbmailhost --user2 u2 --password2 p2 \
         --useheader 'Message-ID' \
         --skipsize \
         --syncinternaldates

I needed it because there are obviously some 
encoding differences between the two servers, and modified headers lead 
to all messages being doubled. Examples:

dbmail:
Content-Type:text/plain; format=flowed; charset=iso-8859-1; 
reply-type=original
cyrus:
Content-Type:text/plain; format=flowed; charset="iso-8859-1"; 
reply-type=original

And also the "Received" headers got blanks added in DBmail, etc.

******************

For a full server copy from cyrus to dbmail I used:
imapsync --host1 cyrus  --user1 x --authuser1 x --password1 x --ssl1  \
         --host2 dbmail --user2 x --authuser2 x --password2 x \
         --skipheader '(^X-|^Received|^MIME-|^Content-Type|^Disposition-|^From|^Cc|^Reply-|^Subject|^To|^DomainKey).*' \
         --skipsize \
         --sep1 '/' --exclude 'user/demo/Trash' \
         --regextrans2 's/^user.//' --syncinternaldates

The 'exclude user/demo/Trash'  was used because there was one message 
there with 8 bit headers which dbmail doesn't accept, so I had to skip 
the whole folder. It would be nice to have an option to just ignore and 
log unsyncable messages, but do the rest, instead of stopping.

******************

There are two other major problems:
1) dbmail doesn't accept utf8 header, while cyrus does. imapsync stops 
in that case, making sync impossible

To convert the wholes messages from 8bit to 7bit, use option :

--regexmess 's/[\x80-\xff]/X/g'

(This is bad since only headers need this).

Q: From MailEnable 1.75
R: --sep1 "/" --prefix1 ""

Q: From MailEnable 2.2
R: --sep1 "." --prefix1 ""

======================================================================
Q. From GMX IMAP4 StreamProxy
R. Use:
   --prefix1 INBOX and --sep1 .

Q. From any to Exchange2007 

Several problems:
- Big messages: increse the "send- and receive-connector" 
  in exchange2007 to 40 MB.

R. 2 solutions

R1. With imapsync (only partial success)
--skipsize --skipheader 'Received' \
--regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?!^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nReceived: From; $2}gxms'
Any user having time to spend to debug Exchange2007 with imapsync
is welcome.

R2. Other solution
Two users succeded by using "MS Transporter Suite" (which is closed
expensive nonfree software).

======================================================================
Q. From Microsoft Exchange 2000 IMAP4rev1 server version 6.0.6487.0.

R. imapsync ... \
   --prefix1 INBOX. --prefix2 INBOX. --syncinternaldates --subscribe \
   --maxsize 10485760

======================================================================
Q: How can I write an .rpm with imapsync
R: I don't know but Neil Brown wrote one rpm package and you'll find
   his .spec file here :

======================================================================
Q: Problems on win32, Timezone and Date::Manip
R: Comment the code like the following

  if ($syncinternaldates) {
     $d = $f_idate;
     $debug and print "internal date from 1: [$d]\n";
     #require Date::Manip;
     #Date::Manip->import(qw(ParseDate Date_Cmp UnixDate));
     #$d = UnixDate(ParseDate($d), "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z");
     #$d = "\"$d\"";
     #$debug and print "internal date from 1: [$d] (fixed)\n";
  }
