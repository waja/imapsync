WINDOWS
=======

There is two ways to install and use imapsync on Windows systems: A) or B).

Standard users should take the A) way, the simplest way.

Developers, or powerful users that want to build their own imapsync.exe
or modify it, have to consider the B) way, the complex but powerful way.

A) Simplest way
---------------

A.1) Get imapsync.

Get imapsync at https://imapsync.lamiral.info/
You'll then have access to a zip archive file named imapsync_1.xxx.zip
where 1.xxx is the imapsync release number.

A.2) Extract the zip file in a folder where you will work with imapsync.

You can work on the Desktop since the zip file extraction creates
a unique folder named imapsync_1.xxx (where 1.xxx is the imapsync 
release number).

A.3) Check the folder

In the folder extracted imapsync_1.xxx you see 6 files and 2 directories:

* README_Windows.txt     is the current file you are reading.
* README.txt             is the imapsync general document.
* FAQ.d/*                FAQs are a good read when something goes wrong.
* imapsync_example.bat   is a simple batch file example you will copy and edit.
* sync_loop_windows.bat  is a batch file example for syncing many accounts.
* file.txt               is an input file example for syncing many accounts.
* imapsync.exe           is the imapsync 32bit binary. You don't have to run it directly.
* imapsync_64bit.exe     is the imapsync 64bit binary. You don't have to run it directly.
* Cook/                  is the directory to build imapsync.exe from its source, 
                         for the B) way and expert users.

You can copy or rename the file imapsync_example.bat as you wish,
as long as its extension remains ".bat".

On Windows systems .bat extension means "I'm a batch script".
It's the same for sync_loop_windows.bat.

The batch scripts have to stay in the same directory than 
imapsync.exe because of the way they call imapsync.exe.
They use ".\imapsync.exe", so let them be in the same directory.

Or you can change the path .\ to whatever you want if you understand what
you are doing (you have to use a pathname from the script point of view).

For the rest of this documentation I assume you copied
imapsync_example.bat to a file named imapsync_stuff.bat

A.4) Edit the batch file

Edit imapsync_stuff.bat and change the values with yours.
In order to edit it you have do a right click on it and select "modify"
in the list presented in the small window menu.
Notepad or Notepadd++ are very good editors to modify it.
Office Word or any powerful text processor are not good for that job, 
don't use them!

Files FAQ.txt and FAQ.d/* contain many tips and special options sometimes
needed by specific imap server softwares like Exchange or Gmail.


A.5) Run the batch file

To run imapsync with your values just double-click on 
the batch file imapsync_stuff.bat

There is no need to have administrator privileges to run imapsync.

A.6) Loop on A.4) A.5) edit, run, edit, run etc.

Loop the process of editing and running imapsync until
you solve all issues and all values suit your needs.

A.7) Look the sync running. You can abort it at any time with a 
 quick double ctrl-c, hit ctrl-c twice within one second.
 (a single ctrl-c will reconnect to both imap servers).
 You can also abort the sync by closing the DOS window.

A.8) When the sync is finished you can find the whole log file 
of the output in the folder named "LOG_imapsync", 
the logfile name is based on the launching date, 
hour, minute, second, milliseconds and the user2 parameter. 

There is one logfile per run.

The logfile name is printed at the end of the imapsync run.
If you do not want logging to a file then use option --nolog


B) Hard way. It is the hard way because it installs all software
   dependencies. This is the way for modifying imapsync.exe if needed.

B.1) Install Perl if it isn't already installed.
  Strawberry Perl is a very good candidate
  http://strawberryperl.com/
  I use 5.26.0.1 (31 may 2017) but previous and later releases 
  should work (5.18 and 5.20 do) as well.

B.2) Go into the Cook/ directory
B.3) Double-clic build_exe.bat 

It should create a binary imapsync.exe in the current Cook/ directory.

B.4) Move imapsync.exe in the upper directory and follow instructions
     from A.3) to A.8)
