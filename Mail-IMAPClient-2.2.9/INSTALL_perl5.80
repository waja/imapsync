Please let me know if you have any problems under perl 5.8.x.

I do know of one issue under perl 5.8.0. If you are installing from
a work directory that contains a double colon in one of the 
component subdirectory names then some of the tests may fail.
For example, I do my development work from a subdirectory that
has "Mail::IMAPClient" in the path, and 'make test' fails for 
the subcomponents of Mail::IMAPClient from that path; the test
harness is unable to locate the ../lib/blib subdirectory and so
cannot load the .pm file. If I install from a different directory 
without "::"'s then everything tests okay. I do not see this with
earlier versions of perl.

A work around is to not install from a subdirectory with "::".

An alternative work around is to do 'make install' before 'make test'. 
This gets around the problem by placing a copy of the necessary files 
in your installation directories, so that even though 'make test' 
cannot find ../blib/lib, it can find the necessary .pm files in your 
(production!) installation libraries so the tests will still succeed.
However, you have to remember to do 'make install' first every time
you install a new version of this module, or you will be testing the
old version instead of the new one.
