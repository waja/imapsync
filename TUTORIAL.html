<H2>Background knowledge about emailboxes</H2>

<P>
Three Internet protocols are used to access almost all email accounts: 
POP3, IMAP, HTTP.
</P>
<P>
The oldest one still used is POP3, Post Office Protocol.  POP3 allows only 
one main box called INBOX. With POP3 messages have no flags, no Seen/UnSeen 
Forwarded Flagged labels. Messages are often
removed from the POP3 server each time a software client looks into it,
so messages only appear on the client host that fetched them, they are
unavailable from any other system located elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The second protocol to deal with email messages is IMAP, Internet Message Access Protocol.
 IMAP allows a hierarchy of mailboxes also called folders, concurrent accesses, 
tagging with flags, search by many criterium like date, subject, size etc.
IMAP protocol presents most of the features POP lacks.
Messages stay on the imap server so any client on the network can access them
at any time from anywhere, the same messages with the same flags.
</P>
<P>
The third protocol to access email messages is HTTP, HyperText Transfer Protocol.
HTTP is the protocol to surf the web. 
Web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
are HTTP client softwares.
Webmails often offer the same features than imap servers because 
webmails underlying storage systems are often imap servers. 
So webmail mailboxes like Gmail, Yahoo, Exchange, Zimbra or Office365 are also accessible via imap. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of this protocol review is that IMAP can be used
to access mailboxes most of the time. Here comes imapsync.
</P>
<P>
Software imapsync is a command line tool to 
copy, migrate, backup or synchronize IMAP mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
Command line means imapsync is not graphical, it is textual, 
you have to type characters on your keyboard. 
Your fingers will not suffer anyway because 
I wrote file examples nearly ready to go. 
Most of the time you only have to change values 
in those files and adapt them to your context.
</P>
<P>
Do not be afraid, the mouse will not be forsaken. 
You can still use the mouse to launch an editor, 
select/copy/paste complete examples 
and run the little script you edit with a doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
Imapsync runs on Unix or Windows.
It is because imapsync is written in the Perl language
and thanks to the Perl creators Perl runs everywhere.
Outside imapsync life is different; 
Historically Windows came after Unix and the marvelous designers 
in  this old times decided it would be very cool 
to not share the same syntax for doing the same things. 
Thanks guys, great thinking! 
</P>
<P>
To avoid you to learn by headaches a system you do not master 
I will give all examples in both worlds, Unix and Windows. 
Macintosh users are in the Unix world now but do not tell them, 
it can hurt the olders.
</P>

<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H2>Conventions</H2>

<P>
Imapsync has many options but you can ignore most of them 
and still make great transfers.
</P>
<P>
In this documentation I write all the examples as a complete example. 
In order to simplify the reading or the printing,
the command is written on several lines. 
It could be written on one single line;
if you prefer the whole command on one line then 
just remove the last character of each line, 
it is the "\" character on Unix examples 
or the "^" character on Windows examples.
</P>
<P>
For example, on Unix
</P>

<PRE>
    imapsync \
       --host1 imap.truc.org \
       --user1 foo \
       --password1 secret1 \
       ...
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to
</P>

<PRE>
    imapsync --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 ...
</PRE>

<P>
and on Windows
</P>

<PRE>
    imapsync.exe ^
       --host1 imap.truc.org ^
       --user1 foo ^
       --password1 secret1 ^
       ...
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to
</P>

<PRE>
    imapsync --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 ...
</PRE>
