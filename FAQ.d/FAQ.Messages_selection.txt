By default, Imapsync syncs all messages, avoiding duplicates.

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify a date range to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share an example?

R. Yes, with the --search option.

  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010"

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify an age to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share some examples?

R. Yes, with the --maxage or the --minage option.

E.1 Sync only messages less than 2 days old:

  imapsync ... --maxage 2

E.2 Sync only messages more than 2 days old:

  imapsync ... --minage 2

E.3 Sync only messages more than 30 days old and less than 365 days old:

  imapsync ... --minage 30 --maxage 365

E.4 Sync only messages less than 30 days old or more than 365 days old:

  imapsync ... --maxage 30 --minage 365

Full explanation:

--maxage      <int>    : Skip messages older than <int> days.
                         final stats (skipped) don't count older messages
                         see also --minage
--minage      <int>    : Skip messages newer than <int> days.
                         final stats (skipped) don't count newer messages
                         You can do (+ are the messages selected):
                         past|----maxage+++++++++++++++>now
                         past|+++++++++++++++minage---->now
                         past|----maxage+++++minage---->now (intersection)
                         past|++++minage-----maxage++++>now (union)



=======================================================================
Q. I want to sync messages based on their UID.

R. First have in mind that UIDs are uniq only per folder, so work this
   way only with one folder at a time, with --folder option.

To show UIDs, there is the --debugLIST parameter.

  imapsync ...  --debugLIST

To sync only a part of all messages, selected by UIDs 
from 10000 to 11000:

  imapsync ... --search1 "UID 10000:11000" 

To sync from INBOX only 3 messages UIDs 20000 20002 20004:

  imapsync ... --search1 'OR OR UID 20000 UID 20002 UID 20004' --folder INBOX

To sync all messages from INBOX except 3 messages 
UIDs 20000 20002 20004:

  imapsync ... --search1 'NOT OR OR UID 20000 UID 20002 UID 20004' --folder INBOX

If you search n UIDs then you have to put n-1 OR in the search line. 
That's IMAP.
