      Imapsync for massive migrations
======================================================================

Questions answered here are:

Q. I need to migrate hundred accounts, how can I do?
Q. I have to migrate 500k users using 400 TB of disk space. 
   How do I proceed?

Q. I need to migrate hundred accounts, how can I do?

R. If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little
shell program. Write a file called file.txt (for example)
containing users and passwords.
The separator used in this example is ";"

The file.txt file contains:

user001_1;password001_1;user001_2;password001_2
user002_1;password002_1;user002_2;password002_2
user003_1;password003_1;user003_2;password003_2
user004_1;password004_1;user004_2;password004_2
user005_1;password005_1;user005_2;password005_2
...

On Unix the shell program can be:

 { while IFS=';' read  u1 p1 u2 p2; do 
	imapsync --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" \
                 --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" ...
 done ; } < file.txt

Here is a complete Unix example nearly ready to use:

On Windows the batch program can be:

  FOR /F "tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=; eol=#" %%G IN (file.txt) DO imapsync ^
  --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 %%G --password1 %%H ^
  --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 %%I --password2 %%J ...

The ... can be replaced by nothing or any supplementary imapsync option.

Q. I have to migrate 500k users using 400 TB of disk space. 
   How do I proceed?

R. Solution to this issue is two words: parallelism and measurements.  
Since all 500k mailboxes are independent against each other, 
they can be processed independently.

500k on 400TB is 800 MB per account on average.

No one knows in advance what is the first bottleneck.  The first
bottleneck has to be determined, by measurements, not by guesses.
Once this first bottleneck is known and overcome then the next
bottleneck has to be determined and overcome too, if needed. Repeat
the process of looking for the next bottleneck and its resolution
until you estimate the transfer rates, money costs and final dates are
good enough to proceed the whole 500k/400TB migration.

Possible bottlenecks: 

- IMAP servers have artificial limits. For example Gmail and Office365
  have throttle limits.

- Bandwidth, on any side, especially on small Internet connexions. But
  usually bandwidth is not a bottleneck. 

- Memory, on any side. Monitor your system doesn't swap on disk.

- CPU, on any side. When measuring that CPU is always 100% during a 
  transfer then it's useless to add imapsync processus on that host.

- I/O on disks. A classical one always forgotten. Unlike CPU and RAM
  Input/Output performances don't improve very much as time goes on.

- Number of hosts available to run imapsync processes.
- Imapsync itself.
- Errors management.
- MX domains, DNS.
- Money.
- Time.
- Bad luck.
- ...
