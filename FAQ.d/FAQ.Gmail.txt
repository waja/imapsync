                    Imapsync with Gmail
======================================================================


=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from XXX to Gmail  

R. There are some details to get the special [Gmail] sub-folders
   right. Here's an example of migrating an old "Sent" folder to
   Gmail's structure:

imapsync --host1 mail.oldhost.com \
         --user1 my_email@oldhost.com \
         --password1 password \
         --host2 imap.gmail.com \
         --user2 my_email@gmail.com \
         --password2 password \
         --ssl2 \
         --exitwhenover 500000000 \
         --maxsize 25000000 \
         --expunge1 \
         --addheader \
         --exclude "\[Gmail\]$"           \
         --regextrans2 "s/[ ]+/_/g"       \
         --regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g"       \
         --regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g"  \
         --regextrans2 "s,^Sent$,[Gmail]/Sent Mail," 

Explanations:

--ssl2 is mandatory since Gmail only supports imap ssl connections.

--exitwhenover 500000000 option is here to avoid locking when 
transfers exceed maximum limit. 
See http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518
--exitwhenover is not mandatory in the sense you may be able to
use an upper value than 500 MB without disconnections; I don't
know the hard value, it seems to vary, so just have some tries
and report me what you discover in case you detect something.

--maxsize 25000000 is mandatory since Gmail limits messages size
up to 25 MB. This value increases over time, it was 10 MB some 
years ago so you can try higher values. The Gmail page about
this limit is https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6584

--expunge1 is optional. It deletes messages marked \Deleted on host1.
Imapsync syncs messages with all their flags, Gmail takes the messages
marked \Deleted but deletes or moves them just after.
Option --expunge1 really removes messages marked \Deleted on host1 
so they are not synced at all.


The --addheader option is there because "Sent" folder messages 
sometimes lack the "Message-Id:" and "Received:" headers needed 
by imapsync to identify messages (only when --useuid is not used). 
So option --addheader adds a "Message-Id" header consisting of
the imap UID of the message on the host1 folder, like
"Message-Id: 12345@imapsync".

--exclude "\[Gmail\]$" is there to avoid a small examine/select error:
"Could not examine: 43 NO [NONEXISTENT] Unknown Mailbox: [Gmail] 
(now in authenticated state) (Failure)".

--regextrans2 "s/[ ]+/_/g" is there to convert blank characters not 
accepted by gmail to character _ underscore. In fact only leading
and trailing blank characters are problems with gmail, and
also successive blanks ending with the IMAP error 
"NO [CANNOT] Folder contains excess whitespace (Failure)"
If you want to change only leading and trailing blank characters
then use the following instead
On Linux/Unix:
  --regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,\$1,g" --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),\$1,g"
On Windows:
  --regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,$1,g" --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),$1,g"


--regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g" is mandatory.  It converts, since
not accepted by gmail, character ^ to character _ underscore.

--regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g" is optional. It converts 
characters ' or " or \ to character _ underscore.

--regextrans2 "s,^Sent$,[Gmail]/Sent Mail," is to transform the
folder name "Sent" and adapt it to Gmail "Sent Mail" folder.
If you're using a different language in Gmail you might adapt
this example with the folder name translated, an example in French:

imapsync ...
	 --regextrans2 "s,^Messages envoy&AOk-s$,[Gmail]/Messages envoy&AOk-s," \


You can add --folder "INBOX.Sent" in the example in case
you want to sync only the "Sent" folder.

You can select folders exported to imap within the gmail preferences,
unselect some  "System labels", depending on your needs.

The "All Mail" archive pseudo-folder should be updated automatically.



=======================================================================
Q. Some of the folders are getting created with [IMAP] prefix on Google
side. How to stop creating folder with this prefix?
Any switch we can use? e.g. [IMAP]/Archive

R. No switch in imapsync since [IMAP]/ prefix is done by Gmail,
   it might be configurable with Gmail parameters.

=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from Gmail to XXX 

R. Gmail needs SSL 

./imapsync \
           --host1 imap.gmail.com \
           --user1 gilles.lamiral@gmail.com \
           --password1 gmailsecret \
           --host2 localhost
           --user2 tata \
           --password2 tatasecret \
           --ssl1 \
           --exitwhenover 2500000000 \
           --useheader="X-Gmail-Received" \
           --useheader "Message-Id" \
           --skipcrossduplicates \
           --folderfirst "Work" \
           --folderfirst "Friends" \
           --folderlast  "CanWait" \
           --folderlast  "[Gmail]/All Mail"


Explanations:

--ssl1 is mandatory since Gmail only supports imap ssl connections.

--exitwhenover 2500000000 option is here to avoid locking when 
transfers exceed maximum limit. 
See http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518
--exitwhenover is not mandatory in the sense you may be able to
use an upper value than 2.5 GB without disconnections; I don't
know the hard value, it seems to vary, so just have some tries
and report me what you discover in case you detect something.

--useheader="X-Gmail-Received" --useheader "Message-Id" are not
mandatory. I use them because I found (several years ago, it may
have changed) that Gmail always adds a different header 
"X-Gmail-Received:" to all messages it gets. So the identification
by imapsync can not fail using this header. "Message-Id" is there
for safety about this Gmail rule.


If your destination imap server doesn't like "[Gmail]" name, just add
option:
           --regextrans2 's/\[Gmail\]/Gmail/'

You can select folders exported to imap within the gmail preferences,
for example you may unselect all "System labels".

--exitwhenover option is here to avoid locking when transfers 
exceed maximum limit. 
See http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518

--skipcrossduplicates is optional but it can save Gigabytes of hard
disk memory. Within imap protocol, Gmail presents Gmail labels as 
folders, so a message labeled "Work" "ProjectX" "Urgent" ends up 
in three different imap folders "Work" "ProjectX" and "Urgent"
after an imap sync. --skipcrossduplicates prevent this behavior.

An issue with --skipcrossduplicates is that the first label synced
by imapsync goes to its corresponding folder and other labels are
ignored. This way, at least you can choose what labels have the 
priority by using the --folderfirst option. For example
--folderfirst "Work" will sync messages labeled "Work" before
messages labeled "CanWait" or "Urgent". By default imapsync 
syncs folders (Gmail labels) using the classical alphanumeric order.

--folderlast "CanWait" will sync only messages that have the
label CanWait and only it.

--folderlast "[Gmail]/All Mail", in conjunction with option 
--skipcrossduplicates, will only put in "[Gmail]/All Mail"
the messages that are not labeled at all.

Q. I can't authenticate with Gmail via IMAP
   Gmail says "Please log in via your web browser"

R1. See Coert Grobbelaar solution:
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/86404/how-do-i-interact-with-google-to-import-email-via-imapsync

R2. I had the same issue one time (mars 2015) logging to Gmail 
with imapsync.
The Gmail imap message error said "Please log in via your web browser"
so I logged for this account via a web browser,
it asked me to receive a code via a mobile, I said yes,
I entered the code and everything went ok. 

=======================================================================
Q. Gmail does not really delete messages in folder [Gmail]/All Mail 
   What happens? What can I do?

R. It's true and explained in Gmail documentation at
https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78755?hl=en

To really remove messages in folder "[Gmail]/All Mail", they have to
be moved to the "Trash" folder and be deleted from "Trash".
   

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync have the capability to do 2 stage authentication for google. 

R. No, imapsync doesn't support 2 stage authentication. 
Reading https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1173270?hl=en
it looks like it can't because imapsync uses imap protocol.

So you have to follow the Google recommendation and generate an 
application-specific password or normal authentication or XOAUTH.

=======================================================================
Q. Is XOAUTH2 authentication available with imapsync?

R. Yes but only on Unix systems and not really well documented. See
* http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync_list/msg02129.html
* https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/pull/25/files

=======================================================================
Q. How to use XOAUTH to globally authenticate gmail users?
   The XOAUTH code and this FAQ item come from Eduardo Bortoluzzi
   Thanks Eduardo!

R. The goal of OAUTH is to migrate all users from/to Google Apps 
   Premier Edition without knowing their passwords.

   The global password is available at the Google Apps control panel, 
   at Advanced Tools -> Manage OAuth domain key.

./imapsync \
    --host1 imap.gmail.com --ssl1 \
    --user1 foo@lab3.dedal.br \
    --password1 secret1 \
    --authmech1 XOAUTH \
    --host2 imap.gmail.com --ssl2 \
    --user2 bar@lab3.dedal.br \
    --password2 secret2 \
    --authmech2 XOAUTH

Google Apps is a paid service, but you can try it for 30 days without any cost.

Some notes about configuring the Google Apps XOAUTH:

 On "Advanced Tools > Manage OAuth domain key > Two-legged OAuth access control" 
    the "Allow access to all APIs" must be checked 
    (https://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=162105)

 OR

 On "Advanced Tools > Manage third party OAuth client access", 
    the configured costumer key must have the scope 
    "https://mail.google.com/" configured 
    (https://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=162106).
